{"name":"KEXP Radio","tagline":"an OSX status bar utility for streaming KEXP!","body":"![](http://mrbware.com/KEXP-radio/KEXP-Radio.png)\r\n\r\nKEXP Radio is an OS X (Mountain Lion - 10.8) status bar utility for streaming KEXP.  I was tired of having to use iTunes to the listen to the stream and wanted a simple utility to use at work.  I hope to evntually add the ability to see the current artist/track, tag favorites (and view/manage), and add more controls (independent volume, start stream on startup, etc...) but for now it's just a simple stream player.  If you'd like the app present in the bar every time you log in add it to SystemPrefs/Users&Groups/LoginItems.\r\n\r\nHere is a [link to the currently released version of KEXP Radio](http://mrbware.com/KEXP-radio/KEXP-Radio.zip) or you can download and build from the source on github at the top of this page.\r\n\r\nFor more info about KEXP vist [KEXP.org](http://www.kexp.org) and if you like what you hear, and are able to, make sure you donate to them!\r\n\r\nThanks and let me know if you have any questions.  \r\nBrian  \r\nTwitter/GitHub: @SasquatchFuzz","google":"UA-38544187-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
