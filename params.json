I was tired of having to use iTunes to the listen to the stream and wanted a simple utility to use at work.  I hope to add the ability to see the current artist/track, tag favorites (and view/manage), and add more controls (independent volume, start stream on startup, etc...) but for now it's just a simple stream player.\r\n\r\nFor more info about KEXP vist [KEXP.org](http://www.kexp.org) and if you like what you hear, and are able to make sure you donate!\r\n\r\nThanks and let me know if you have any questions.\r\nBrian\r\nTwitter: @SasquatchFuzz","google":"UA-38544187-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
