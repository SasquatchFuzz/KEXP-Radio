KEXP-Radio
==========

KEXP Radio is an OS X (Mountain Lion/10.8) status bar utility for streaming KEXP. I was tired of having to use iTunes to the listen to the stream and wanted a simple utility to use at work. I hope to add the ability to see the current artist/track, tag favorites (and view/manage), and add more controls (independent volume, start stream on startup, etc...) but for now it's just a simple stream player.

I'm not affiliated with KEXP but just a passionate listner.  For more info about KEXP see below and if you like what you hear be sure to donate to them.

=== About KEXP - www.KEXP.org ====

KEXP is more than a radio station. KEXP is a dynamic arts organization that provides rich music experiences on the air, online, and on the streets. KEXP’s unique services benefit three distinct groups: Music Lovers, Artists, and the Arts Community. 

KEXP’s curatorial staff of 40 DJs, who are widely recognized as experts in their field, present the newest emerging popular artists alongside established bands. KEXP’s programming features both variety and specialty shows that brings you the emerging sounds and long-time favorites from the Pacific Northwest, the country, and throughout the world. 

Artists championed by KEXP are not typically supported by traditional non-profit arts organizations or commercial media outlets. They are inventive, contemporary musicians creating new work in popular genres that include rock, hip hop, reggae, country, Latin, modern global and more. For a full list of programs, visit KEXP’s Shows section.

Check out the On Demand section of KEXP.ORG to find services like the real-time playlist, a two-week archive of KEXP's radio programs, and six different podcasts, distributing hundreds of hours of music—for free! 

KEXP is a service of the University of Washington, who holds the station’s FCC license. As a 501(c)3 non-profit arts organization, KEXP relies on investments from individual, foundation, business, and government supporters.
